Relocatable Software: Issues, Tools and Techniques
==================================================
A **Relocatable** software package is one in which the contents of the package
(programs, libraries, resource files) can be moved lock stock from its
initial installation location to anywhere else on the filesystem and still
run *without* user intervention. Implementing this ability in software
provides several benefits, including

- Minimal setup for end users, as they do not need to set package-specific
  environment variables or edit configuration files
- Easier binary packaging and deployment, as binaries do not require
  installation at the same location either at install or use time (e.g.
  NFS/AFS/CVMFS mount point)

This document describes some of the issues that arise in implementing relocatability
in software packages from the source code to binary packaging level, and
discusses tools and techniques to help the developer and end user. Several
example projects in C++ and Python are provided as illustrations.
Whilst primarily concerned with the "front line" programming languages
used in HEP (C, C++ and Python), it is open to comments and examples
from others in use or under consideration.

What is Relocatability?
=======================
Say we have installed a package `HSFReloc` that comprises a program, library, plugins, and
resource files:

```
/home/
 +- user/
    +- Projects/
       +- HSFReloc/
          +- bin/
          |  +- hsfreloc >------------------- >---
          +- include/                       |    |
          |  +- hsfreloc.h                  |    |
          +- lib/                           |    |
          |  +- libhsfreloc.so <---- links to    |
          |  +- plugins/     |                   |
          |  |  +- a.so    <-|                   |
          |  |  +- b.so    <-| loads             |
          |  +- cmake/                           |
          |  |  +- HSFReloc/                     |
          |  |     +- HSFRelocConfig.cmake       |
          |  +- pkgconfig/                       |
          |     +- HSFReloc.pc                   |
          +- share/                              |
             +- HSFReloc/                        |
                +- resource.txt <----------- reads
```

If `HSFReloc` is relocatable, then we can move its contents across the filesystem, e.g.:

```
$ mv /home/user/Projects/HSFReloc /home/user/Another/Workspace
...

/home/
 +- user/
    +- Another/
       +- Workspace/
          +- HSFreloc/
             +- bin/
             |  +- hsfreloc
             +- include/
             |  +- hsfreloc.h
             +- lib/
             |  +- libhsfreloc.so
             |  +- plugins/
             |  |  +- a.so
             |  |  +- b.so
             |  +- cmake/
             |  |  +- HSFReloc/
             |  |     +- HSFRelocConfig.cmake
             |  +- pkgconfig/
             |     +- HSFReloc.pc
             +- share/
                +- HSFReloc/
                   +- resource.txt
```

and the user would be able to run `hsfreloc` or link to `libhsfreloc` without making *any* changes
either to the files comprising `HSFReloc` or the runtime environment (`PATH`
might be edited for convenience, but `hsfreloc` would still be runnable via a fully
qualified path). _Note that the relocation keeps the files comprising
`HSFreloc` in the same locations relative to each other_.
[OS X Application and Framework Bundles/Packages](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000123i)
are the classic example of relocatable programs and libraries respectively, and
the term 'Portable Binary' is often used on Linux.

Though basic, this example illustrates three of the core issues of relocatability and
the corresponding technical aspects:

- **How does `hsfreloc` locate its dynamic library `libhsfreloc.so` dependency at runtime?**
  - _Link/Run time lookup of dynamic libraries_
- **How does `hsfreloc` locate its `resource.txt` file, or `libhsfreloc` its plugins at runtime?**
  - _Binary self-location on the filesystem at runtime_
- **How do `HSFReloc`'s CMake and pkg-config support files find `HSFReloc`'s library and headers
  when used by a client?**
  - _Script self-location on the filesystem at runtime_

A further item to be considered is what happens if `HSFReloc` uses files
from another package (e.g. `hsfreloc` or `libhsfreloc` links to a "`libbar`").
This is deferred to a later section.

Whilst the example only illustrates moving a package across a local
filesystem, it is equally valid for moves across network filesystems with
different mount points or even between different systems. Of course the package is then only usable if the
OS/toolchain mounting the filesystem is the same, or binary compatible
with, the OS/toolchain the package was built for. Though not a direct
issue for relocatability, programming and compiling for binary
compatibility are helpful for simplifying binary packaging and deployment.
 The issues here include:

- Software development
  - Mostly a training/policy issue for individual projects (but perhaps HSF can help)
  - Clear and well-managed API/ABI versioning, especially for compiled languages
    - Ensures software can be used by as wide a range of upstream clients as possible
    - Nevertheless, can be tricky for [languages like C++](https://community.kde.org/Policies/Binary_Compatibility_Issues_With_C%2B%2B)
    - There [are tools to help check compatibility](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_check_for_ABI_changes_in_a_package) at least for ELF, but needs a more thorough survey.
  - Program for compatibility with multiple versions of any dependencies
    - Dependencies should provide a versioning header [as per HSF (draft) guidelines](https://github.com/HEP-SF/documents/blob/master/HSF-TN/draft-2016-PROJ/draft-HSF-TN-2016-PROJ.md)
  - Hide dependencies as implementation details as far as possible.
  - Consider versioned symbols and/or inlined namespaces?
- Building binaries
  - Policy issue for packager(s).
  - Target minimal system API/ABI, e.g. `-mmacosx-min-version` on OS X or build for suitable
    minimum glibc on Linux.
  - On Linux, consider "standalone" toolkit of glibc, binutils, gcc.



Self-Location of Compiled and Interpreted Executables
=====================================================
How can a program or library introspect itself when running to find out where on the
filesystem it was loaded from? If we know this location, then default
resource files and search paths can easily be derived from known relative
locations. For example, say the `Foo` application is written in C++
and uses a `resource.txt` file:

```
+- <PREFIX>
   +- bin/
   |  +- hsfreloc
   +- share/
      +- hsfreloc/
         +- resource.txt
```

A typical solution to locating `resource.txt` at runtime would be to use an
environment variable and query this in the program, e.g. in C/C++:

```C++
const char* resourcePath = getenv("HSFRELOC_RESOURCE_PATH");
```

Whilst this does enable relocatability, it relies on the user setting this
variable correctly, knowing to do so, and changing it if the package is
moved. It is easier if the binary can introspect itself at runtime
to determine where on the filesystem its physical file is stored - this
is _self-location_. Using this information, the path to the `resource.txt`
file can be determined by joining the binary file path with the
_relative path_ from it to the resource file. Here, the relative path is known
at compile/install time so is hard-coded into the binary, but because
it is relative, the "bundle" of binary and resource may be freely
moved together without invalidating the relative path between the files.

There are various language dependent techniques to implement
self-location in applications and libraries. Self-locating *resources*
(e.g. `A.txt` "loads" `../extra/B.txt` in a hierarchical system) is
outside the scope of this document as it is highly implementation
dependent. The sections below describe
the minimal (as far as is known) code needed to obtain the location
of the currently executing program or library for a handful of languages,
and additions are welcome. Note that languages may have additional
builtins or simple extensions to handle either self-location or the
specific use case of locating resource files (e.g., see the notes
on the Go language below).

Python
------
The full path to the current file is easily obtained using the `os`
module:

```Python
import os
selfLocation = os.path.realpath(__file__)
```

This is equally valid for programs, modules and packages.

Ruby
----
Ruby's construct is very similar to Python, using the `File` builtin

```Ruby
selfLocation = File.expand_path(__FILE__)
```

This should be equally valid for programs and gems/packages.

Go

Bash
----
An executable script can be located using the `readlink` command on
the `$0` command line argument, though this does not resolve hardlinks.
Whilst GNU `readlink` can fully traverse softlinks using the `-f`
argument, this is not portable.

```Bash
# GNU readlink only
selfLocation=$(readlink -f $0)
```

For `readlink` implementations not supporting the `-f` argument,
workarounds are needed. Depending on the platform, these may vary from
using Python (!, though not unreasonable on OS X platforms) to pure
Bash/Sh implementations. The latter basically involve iterating over any
sequence of symlinks. A discussion on this with example implementations is [covered on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1055671/how-can-i-get-the-behavior-of-gnus-readlink-f-on-a-mac)


C/C++
-----
Though C/C++ applications *may* get passed a string *representing* the program name as the zeroth element of the `argv` argument to `main`:

```C++
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  std::cout << argv[0] << "\n";
}
```

this is not *guaranteed* to be the actual filesystem location of the program
(see, for example
[this discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2050961/is-argv0-name-of-executable-an-accepted-standard-or-just-a-common-conventi)
).
In particular, the actual invocation of a program may be through a soft or hard link whose
filesystem location is completely separate from that of the executable.
Though links can be followed to some extent, hardlinks in particular cannot
easily be resolved. Rather, most self-location relies on querying the
*process* itself.

Some basic techniques, but also APIs, are demonstrated in the [`HSFReloc`](HSFReloc`) example project, including

- [binreloc](https://github.com/drbenmorgan/Resourceful) at low level for C/C++
- C++ Application objects in frameworks such as:
  - [Qt](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcoreapplication.html#applicationDirPath)
  - [Poco](http://pocoproject.org/docs/Poco.Util.Application.html)

There are some paths to resource files that, depending on exact use case, may require
hard-coding or use of standard environment variables. On UNIX these are typically the
directories used for/by system programs, or for temporary usage.

- `/etc`
- `/var`
- `/tmp` or `TMPDIR`

(Re)Locating the Interpreter for Programs
=========================================
Programs implemented using intepreted languages such as Python are usually written as scripts using (on Unix platforms)
a ["shebang"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) on the first line to define the interpreter program to pass the remainder of the script to. For example, a Python "hello world" program might be written as

```Python
#!/usr/bin/python

print("hello world")
```

This hard codes the system interpreter into the program and whilst this program is relocatable (assuming a valid system
Python install), it cannot be used with any other interpreter. Typical HEP software stacks install, and require use of,
their own interpreters, whose paths may also end up hard coded into scripts:

```Python
#!/custom/stack/root/python/2.7/bin/python

print("hello world")
```

The resulting stack is then not relocatable as the interpreter path will not exist after relocation.

Rather than hard coding system or custom interpreter paths, script authors should prefer the use of the
[`env`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/env.html) program as the shebang, e.g.

```Python
#!/usr/bin/env python

print("hello world")
```

Use of `env` makes the program relocatble, but defers location of the interpreter to the `PATH` environment variable,
and consequently the configuration management system for the software stack. Whilst package authors should prefer
usage of the `env` pattern, software stack managers can also consider rewriting the shebang line during install
and on any relocation to the absolute path of the required interpreter. As it is plain text, simple regular expression
replacement can be used, but the chosen packaging system must support this, and care must be taken
if the resultant stack is to be deployed over network file systems (and hence unknown mount points).

**TODO?** Binaries *also* have an interpreter (on Linux, `ld-linux.so`, On macOS, `dyld`). These are also hardcoded,
though can be changed with, e.g., `patchelf` for ELF binaries.


(Re)Locating Dynamic Libraries
==============================
A non-trivial package will usually be partioned into a main
program/libraries linking to 1-N internal, plus 0-M external, libraries.
For [static libraries/linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_library), the libraries only need locating at build/link time.
When [dynamic/shared libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker)
are used, client programs/libraries must locate the needed libraries at
both build/link and *run* times, and it is this run time location
that is discussed here.

**TODO**: How the dynamic linker/loader works on different platforms. Topics include:

- Dynamic loader paths, including `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `RPATH` and `RUNPATH` (inc. `@rpath`
and others on OS X, `$ORIGIN` on Linux), plus Windows DLL search paths.
- Relative RPATHs, both on [OS X](http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/510) and [Linux](http://linux.die.net/man/8/ld.so)
- Lookup paths when implementing "Plugin" architectures (i.e. loading dynamic libraries into an already running program)

Dynamic programs and libraries can be queried by system tools to display what they link to and how these paths are resolved.
To query what a dynamic executable links to, the commands

```console
... Linux ...
$ ldd <dynamicexecutable>

... OS X ...
$ otool -L <dynamicexecutable>
```

may be used. Additionally, detailed runtime information on how the dynamic linker/loader resolves links when loading/running the program can be obtained by setting platform specific environment variables, e.g.

```console
... Linux ...
$ LD_DEBUG=all <program>

... OS X ...
$ export DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1
$ export DYLD_PRINT_RPATHS=1
$ <program>
```

These can be useful for tracing runtime issues. See the `ld.so/ld-linux.so` (Linux) or `dyld` (OS X) `man` pages for additional details.

**TODO**: Remember to document the odd difference in behaviour of `$ORIGIN` between link and run times. Basically, it appears that binutils `ld` *does not* expand it at link time, which can result in error messages about needing `-rpath-link`. This *appears* to be a [missing feature or bug in binutils](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16936)

**TODO**: Behaviour of tools of as CMake and Autotools, which encode
the rpath into the locally built binaries by default. This enables them
to be run directly for testing and guarantees that they will find their
dependencies. At install time, rpaths are usually stripped, unless
configured otherwise.


(Re)Locating Language Modules
=============================
**TODO** How to handle module lookup, e.g. `PYTHONPATH` for Python (other languages?). Things that package authors can do.
Things that the packaging system should do (inc. any packaging system provided by the language, e.g. `pip`, `virtualenv`).
Things best left to configuration management.




Relocatability with External Dependencies
=========================================

What happens to relocatability when we have two packages with a dependency?
For example `Foo` and `Bar`, with `Foo` linking to `libbar` from `Bar`.

1. Can move `Foo` if its `RPATH` contains absolute path to `libbar`.
2. Cannot move `Bar` without updating `Foo`'s RPATH or using/updating dynamic
   loader paths
3. Can move both `Foo` and `Bar` provided relative RPATHs
   are used and both stay in the same locations relative to each other.

**TODO**: Cases for text/resource file dependencies?



Patching Upstream Software
==========================
The preceeding sections cover cases where "we" are developing the
software, or have identified relocatability issues and are in a
position to patch these. Typical HEP software
stacks will use a large number of packages not directly maintained by
the experiment/community using them, and not all of them may meet the
criteria for full relocatability. How to handle these?

In the first instance, a feature request should always be put in with the
upstream maintainers. Other techniques for patching are discussed
below.

Self-Location
-------------
If a program uses environment variables to set paths for resource
location, then one way to non-intrusively patch this is to create
a self-locating Bash/Python script wrapping the actual executable.
The script can contain the derived relative path(s) needed and set
these at runtime before executing the actual program, forwarding any
additional arguments.

For libraries using environment variables, it may be possible to wrap
these with a small facade library. This would do nothing more that
self-locate, set the needed environment variables and expose the rest
of the library symbols. However, this has implications for usability
and runtime manipulation of the environment by clients.

When absolute paths are hardcoded into binaries, then only intrusive
patching is likely to work. For simple cases, application of the
techniques discussed earlier may be able to provide a fully relocatable
solution. At worst, hard coded paths could be replaced with environment
variable lookup and wrapper scripts. In more complex cases, it may be possible to patch the
binary directly at install time (**TODO**: tools for this?) to
rewrite hardcoded paths. Note that this still results in hard coded
paths, so can only really be handled by a package manager system and would
not work for deploying software over network file systems where final
mount points are not guaranteed to be identical.

Interpreter Paths
-----------------
Shebangs are plain text, so are straightforward to patch directly using regular expression
find/replace directly, or via tooling at build or install time.

Library RPATHs
--------------
1. RPATHs can be changed at install time by the packaging system/tools (`patchelf`, `otool`, `install_name_tool` etc)
2. Runtime/chroot based tools like [PRoot](https://github.com/proot-me/PRoot/blob/master/doc/proot/manual.txt) may
also be useful.


Relocation and Packaging
========================
**TODO** Topics involving relocatability when it comes to the packaging level. Define "packaging" as the things we need
to do/write to allow `spack|brew|whatever install mypackage` to work, whether building `mypackage` from source locally
or downloading and unpacking a binary. The "package manager" needs to include tooling to manage relocation, and this
may include things like changing RPATHs in binaries, to shebangs in interpreted programs. Other topics like deployment
to CVMFS etc.

Take simple example of two packages and a "typical" versioned tree plus "views"? e.g.

```
+- whateverroot/
   +- packages/
   |   +- Foo/
   |   |  +- 1.0/
   |   |  |   +- bin/
   |   |  |   +- lib/
   |   |  |   +- ...
   |   |  +- 2.0/
   |   |     +- ...
   |   +- Bar/
   |      +- 1.0-usingFoo1.0/
   |      |  +- bin/
   |      |  +- lib/
   |      +- 1.0-usingFoo2.0/
   |         +- bin/
   |         +- lib/
   +- views/
      +- release-1.0/
      |  +- bin/
      |  +- lib/
      +- release-2.0/
         +- bin/
         +- lib/
```

Assume Foo/Bar are relocatable according to earlier topics, how should package manager deal with pointing Bar to its
needed Foo, and how do views work in this case?


Conclusions
