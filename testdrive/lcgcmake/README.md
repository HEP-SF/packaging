# Test Driving the LCGCMake Package Manager

This document will walk you through preparing and using the [LCGCMake](https://gitlab.cern.ch/sft/lcgcmake)
package manager to install a basic software stack for HEP.

LCGCMake is the EP-SFT infrastructure to build the software stack for the LHC experiments
containing both external software dependencies and projects developed within our group.
The tool is based on the [ExternalProject](http://www.kitware.com/media/html/BuildingExternalProjectsWithCMake2.8.html) module
of [CMake](https://cmake.org/).


## Base Operating System Install

_**AUTHORS:**_ _Assume a base system of macOS High Sierra with Xcode 9, or a Docker Image based on centos:centos7 or
ubuntu:xenial. In the Docker case, supply (a) Dockerfile(s) for each system, adding any additional system packages
required, and (b) an `hsf` user with `sudo` privileges that the container will run as. Thereâ€™s no requirement
to build and host the images. Bonus points: Singularity! If macOS needs additional packages, document them below:_

Test driving LCGCMake requires either a CentOS6/7, Ubuntu 16.04LTS, or macOS High Sierra system. For macOS, only the base system
plus Xcode 9 from the App Store is required. Additional platform-specific requirements are specified on the official [documentation](https://gitlab.cern.ch/sft/lcgcmake#pre-requisites).
For convenience and reproducibility, Docker images are available for Linux, and can be obtained and run as follows:

```
# To pull it from dockerhub
docker pull hepsoftwarefoundation/c7-lcgcmake:latest

# ... or to directly run it (with implicit download if needed)
docker run -it hepsoftwarefoundation/c7-lcgcmake:latest bash
```

**Not yet uploaed**, meanwhile:

```
# To pull it from dockerhub
docker pull javiercvilla/c7-lcgcmake:latest

# ... or to directly run it (with implicit download if needed)
docker run -it javiervilla/c7-lcgcmake:latest bash
```

Optionally, you may use an existing Linux installation, but you may encounter errors in subsequent steps if it is missing
(or has incompatible) packages, or your environment has custom settings.

## Installing LCGCMake

To install LCGCMake just checkout the lcgcmake package from lcgsoft GIT repository:

```
git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/sft/lcgcmake.git
```

Then create a workspace area on which to perform the builds:

```
mkdir lcgcmake-build
cd lcgcmake-build
```

Finally check your installation running a simple build:

```
cmake -DLCG_VERSION=hsf -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../lcgcmake-install ../lcgcmake
```

This will configure the whole LCGCMake project using the package versions specified in `lcgcmake/cmake/toolchain/heptools-hsf.cmake`,
which looks like this:

```
# Application Area Projects
LCG_AA_project(ROOT  v6.12.06)
LCG_AA_project(Geant4 10.04.p01)
LCG_AA_project(HepMC 2.06.09)

# Externals

# ROOT Dependencies
LCG_external_package(Python            2.7.14                                   )
LCG_external_package(fftw              3.3.4                     fftw3          )
LCG_external_package(graphviz          2.28.0                                   )
LCG_external_package(GSL               2.4                                      )
```

The output of the former command should be similar to this:

```
-- The C compiler identification is GNU 4.8.5
-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 4.8.5
-- The Fortran compiler identification is GNU 4.8.5
-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc

```

As you can see, since we have not configured any specific compiler, LCGCMake uses the default one provided by
the system. Other compilers can also be used by setting up the following environment variables:

- `PATH`, including the `bin` directory of the external compiler
- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. including the `lib64` directory

and overriding `FC`, `CC` and `CXX`, for example:

```
export FC=`which gfortran`
export CXX=`which g++`
export CC=`which gcc`
```

If you are running a docker container with the `c7-lcgcmake` image, a more recent gcc compiler is already
installed, to set it up just run the following command:

```
scl enable devtoolset-6 bash
```

This will run a different bash session where `gcc-6.3.1` is set as the main compiler, so LCGCMake will use it
by default.

Once the project has been configured, packages defined in `lcgcmake/cmake/toolchain/heptools-hsf.cmake` can be
built and installed using:

```
make -jN <package>
```

To build all the packages defined in the heptool file, we can also use:

```
make -jN
```

The whole list of available packages can be shown using:

```
make help
```

For example, we can check our installation installing `zlib`. it should look like this:

```
[hsf@c3255eb2aa38 lcgcmake-build]$ make -j24 zlib

```

As a result, `zlib` gets installed in the directory specify by the cmake options `DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, which in this example is `/build/lcgcmake-install`:

```
[hsf@c3255eb2aa38 lcgcmake-build]$ ls /build/lcgcmake-install/zlib/1.2.11/x86_64-centos7-gcc48-opt/
gen-post-install.log  include  lib  logs  share  version.txt  zlib-env.sh
```


## Installing the HEP Test Stack
The HSF Test Stack packages are as follows:

- **Toolchain**
  - GCC 6.4
    - With c, c++, fortran languages
  - Python 2.7.14
- **Core HEP Stack**
  - Boost 1.65
  - ROOT 6.12.06
    - Including PyROOT, MathMore
  - GSL 2.4
  - Qt5 5.10 (`qtbase` only)
  - Xerces-C 3.1.4
  - CLHEP (_Version to be compatible with Geant4_)
  - Geant4 10.3

To install this stack, just run:

```
make -jN
```

this will trigger the installation of all packages defined in `lcgcmake/cmake/toolchain/heptools-hsf.cmake`.
This file currently contains the packages above-mentioned plus all their dependencies.

For each package, the source tarfile will be download from a private repo in EOS. This could be modified by
any other source, like the original webpage or its github repo, on the recipe of the package. These recipes
are splitted in different `CMakeLists.txt`:

- Project packages (ROOT, Geant4, HepMC): `lcgcmake/project/CMakeLists.txt`
- Project packages (MonteCarlo generator packages): `lcgcmake/generators/CMakeLists.txt`
- Project packages (rest of the packages): `lcgcmake/externals/CMakeLists.txt`

(NOTE: Binary installation would imply modifying the installation steps defined for each package)

Optionally, ...

_**AUTHORS:**_ _Show any other features of the tool you think are useful here, e.g. build using different C++ Standards,
optional components of packages, different package versions_

# Using the HEP Test Stack
To use the freshly installed test stack, it is quite convenient to build a `view`:

```
make view
```

which will be created again on the directory specify by `DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. This view contains a `setup.sh`
script to set a new environment with all the packages ready to be used:

```
source /build/lcgcmake-install/<platform-tag>/setup.sh
```


_**AUTHORS:**_ _Document the steps needed to setup a runtime environment for using
the stack listed above, including optional parts if the tools allows this_

# Adding a New Package to the Stack

To add a new package to the stack, first you will need to add new package and its version to the list of packages in
the heptool file (`lcgcmake/heptools-hsf.cmake` in our case) and steps to configure, build and install the package (as
well as any other required step) to the correspondant `CMakeLists.txt` file. For example, if we wanted to add `GSL-2.4` to our
stack we would add the following code:

```
// In heptools-XX.cmake ----------------------------------------------
LCG_external_package(clang  3.9.0)

//In externals/CMakeLists.txt-----------------------------------------

#----clang------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LCGPackage_Add(
  clang
  URL ${GenURL}/llvm-${clang_native_version}.tar.gz
  CMAKE_ARGS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}
             -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host
             -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON
             -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<INSTALL_DIR>
             -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF
             -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=OFF
  BUILD_COMMAND ${MAKE} clang
  INSTALL_COMMAND ${MAKE} install
  DEPENDS Python zlib
)
```


_**AUTHORS:**_ _Document the steps needed to create a package for a simple C/C++
library or application (your choice) and walkthrough the steps to build and install it. Reuse/link to the tool's
own documentation on this if you think it's sufficient_
