The Fermilab Scientific Computing Division's Scientific Software
Development Group has organizational goals of developing and supporting
the software infrastructure relied upon by current and planned Intensity
Frontier experiments, as well as Cosmology experiments and projects. The
group has a working set of tools for _product management_, _product
development_, _integration of multiple products_, and _building of
software for release_. The requirements contained here summarize
essential functionality that is currently used or known to be needed by
supported experiments and other users.
